# PDE_Project
Course Project on basic PDE equations.
In this project, I used methods like finite differences and finite elements to solve equations.
the equations:
1. Laplace's Equation
2. Poisson's Equation (with the same boundary conditions a Laplace's)
3. Homogeneous 2D Heat Equation
4. Non-Homogeneous 2D Heat Equation
